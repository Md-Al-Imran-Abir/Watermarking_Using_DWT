# Watermarking_Using_DWT
MSc project for the course Digital Image Processing
In this project, I have to watermark an RGB image into the frames of a video. To this end I will use 2D discrete wavelet transformation. The project is inspired by a conference paper titled "RGB image watermarking on video frames using DWT" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6949263/).
